##  Note for Reviewers

While not all tests in this repository are currently passing, I urge you to check out my other project where I’ve built a **decentralized uptime monitoring platform**. (https://github.com/Freakycoder/iot-depin)

I’m genuinely passionate about **Web3** and excited about building meaningful tools in this space.

This is a sincere request to **consider me for an interview** to join the bootcamp. I'm highly motivated to learn, grow, and contribute actively to the Web3 ecosystem.

Thank you for your time and consideration 🙏
